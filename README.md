# Weather App
# Kian Silva
One of the significant projects Iâ€™ve worked on is a weather application that began as a proof of concept in working with APIs during the summer of my freshman year at Sarah Lawrence Collge. This project was part of an internship with PharmaCCX, where I aimed to gain practical experience with APIs and ensured the end-to-end connection of their platforms APIs. The initial goal was to understand how to fetch and display weather data from external sources.

The app utilizes the OpenWeatherAPI to provide weather information. While the application generally performs well, it does encounter occasional errors when searching for specific cities. Despite these issues, the app effectively showcases its intended functionality and has been enhanced with various style adjustments and minor improvements over time.

Feel free to explore the app and see how it handles real-time weather data!
